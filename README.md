# 2048-game

An implementation of the popular 2048 game in Java for my final project in CIS 110, 
Spring 2018, my first programming course. 

To run, execute the Game2048.java file. Move board around with
keys w, s, a, d for directions up, down, left, and right. When game is over,
click play again button to restart the game. If you win, click play again 
button to restart the game or the keep going button to play in "endless" mode.        


Board.java purpose is to be the Board object. It holds the Tile inner class, 
which is itself an object. Also holds all the methods for Tile and Board class
to assist in making board moves, checking if game has been won, and restarting
the game. 
                          
Game2048.java purpose is to be the main class where the game itself is 
implemented and illustrated for usage. Here users will run this program to
play the game, including seeing the tiles and inputting controls.

Move board around with
keys w, s, a, d for directions up, down, left, and right. When game is over,
click play again button to restart the game. If you win, click play again 
button to restart the game or the keep going button to play in "endless" mode.
